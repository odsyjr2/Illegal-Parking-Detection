# Project: Illegal Parking Detection & Enforcement System

## 1. Project Overview

This project aims to build an end-to-end system for detecting illegally parked vehicles from multiple CCTV streams. The system will automatically track vehicles, identify illegal parking events, generate violation reports via OCR, and provide data for recommending patrol routes.

The core architecture involves a **standalone Python AI processor** for video analysis and a Spring-based backend for business logic and data management. The AI processor operates as a daemon that continuously monitors CCTV streams and reports violations to the Spring backend via REST API, ensuring a scalable and maintainable system.

## 2. Core Features & System Flow

The system operates in a three-stage pipeline:

**Stage 1: Vehicle Tracking and Parking Detection**
- **Input:** Real-time CCTV video streams (via public API) or pre-recorded video files for testing.
- **Process:**
    - Utilizes a YOLO model from the Ultralytics framework for real-time vehicle detection and tracking across multiple video feeds.
    - Monitors the duration each vehicle remains stationary.
    - If a vehicle stays parked for longer than a predefined threshold (configurable in `config.yaml`), the system flags it as a potential violation.
- **Output:** A timestamped image (frame) of the parked vehicle.

**Stage 2: Illegal Parking Verification**
- **Input:** The image of the parked vehicle from Stage 1.
- **Process:**
    - A second YOLO model analyzes the image to determine if the parking is illegal (e.g., parked on a crosswalk, in a no-parking zone).
    - The system cross-references the vehicle's location (latitude/longitude) and the timestamp with a database of legal parking zones and hours. This information is managed by the Spring backend and can be updated via the frontend.
    - A final decision is made: an event is only confirmed as an "illegal parking violation" if both the AI model and the location/time-based rules identify it as such.
- **Output:** A confirmed illegal parking event with location, time, and image.

**Stage 3: Reporting and Data Provisioning**
- **Input:** A confirmed illegal parking event.
- **Process:**
    - The system attempts to read the vehicle's license plate from the image using OCR.
    - **If OCR is successful:**
        - The recognized license plate number is used to automatically generate a violation report.
    - **If OCR is unsuccessful (e.g., due to poor image quality, angle, or obstruction):**
        - The system logs the location (latitude/longitude) and time of the violation. This data is then provided to a separate module responsible for calculating and recommending optimal patrol routes for enforcement officers.
- **Output:** An automated report or data for the patrol route recommendation system.

## 5. System Architecture & Role Division

To create a cohesive and efficient system, the responsibilities are clearly divided. The core principle is that the **Python AI server performs all ML-related analysis in a single, streamlined pipeline**, while the **Spring Boot backend handles final validation, business logic, and data persistence**.

### Python AI Processor (Standalone): The Analysis Engine

This standalone processor operates as a specialized analysis engine using a two-phase architecture for optimal resource management and scalability.

**Key Responsibilities & Workflow:**

1.  **Phase 1 - Continuous Monitoring:** Lightweight, always-on process that monitors all CCTV streams simultaneously
    *   **Real-time Vehicle Tracking:** YOLO-based detection and tracking across multiple streams
    *   **Parking Duration Monitoring:** Tracks how long each vehicle remains stationary
    *   **Violation Candidate Detection:** Identifies potential violations when parking duration exceeds threshold
    *   **Task Queue Creation:** Packages violation candidates into analysis tasks for Phase 2

2.  **Phase 2 - Detailed Analysis:** Heavy AI processing triggered by violation candidates from Phase 1
    *   **Illegal Parking Classification:** YOLO model determines if parking situation is truly illegal
    *   **License Plate Detection:** Fine-tuned YOLO model locates and extracts license plate regions
    *   **OCR Processing:** EasyOCR reads Korean license plate text with validation
    *   **Comprehensive Report Generation:** Creates detailed violation report with all AI analysis results

3.  **Backend Communication:** Sends complete violation reports to Spring Backend via REST API
    *   **Structured JSON Payload:** Includes classification confidence, license plate text, image data, location, timestamp
    *   **Retry Mechanisms:** Robust error handling with exponential backoff for network failures
    *   **Asynchronous Processing:** Non-blocking communication maintains real-time monitoring performance

This two-phase approach ensures efficient resource utilization while maintaining real-time processing capabilities.

### Spring Boot Backend: The Central Orchestrator

The Spring backend is the brain of the operation, using the rich data from the AI server to make final decisions and manage the application state.

**Key Responsibilities & Workflow:**

1.  **Initiate and Receive:** Sends analysis requests to the AI server and receives the comprehensive JSON response.
2.  **Final Verification:** It performs the definitive check. The core logic is:
    *   `IF (response.is_illegal_by_model == true) AND (the location/time is NOT a legal parking zone according to the DB)`
    *   `THEN the event is a confirmed violation.`
3.  **Conditional Processing:**
    *   **If confirmed as a violation:** It uses the **already-provided** `license_plate` data from the JSON response to generate a report. There is **no need to send a second request** to the AI server for OCR.
    *   **If not a violation:** The entire JSON payload for that event can be discarded or logged for statistical purposes.
4.  **Data Persistence & API Service:**
    *   Saves all confirmed violation records to the database.
    *   Manages all other application data (CCTV info, legal parking zones, etc.).
    *   Serves data to the frontend via REST APIs.
